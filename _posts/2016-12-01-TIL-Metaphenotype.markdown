## Abstract

There is an urgent need for reliable effective therapy for patients with
metastatic sarcoma. Approaches that manipulate the immune system have shown
promise for patients with advanced, widely disseminated malignancies. One of
these approaches is adoptive cell therapy (ACT), where tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL) are isolated from the tumor, expanded ex vivo, and then
transferred back to the patient. This approach has shown great promise in
melanoma, leading to an objective response in approximately half of treated
patients [14]. Standard protocols involve characterization of TIL populations
with respect to adaptive CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, but neglect the possible
role of the innate lymphoid repertoire. Due to toxicity and the high cost
associated with ACT, the IFN-γ release assay is currently used as a proxy to
identify suitable TIL isolates for ACT. Efforts in TIL-ACT for sarcoma, which
are pre-clinical and pioneered at Moffitt Cancer Center, have shown that only a
minority of the TIL cultures show tumor specific activity in ex vivo IFN-γ
assays. Surprisingly, internal melanoma trial data reveal a lack of correlation
between IFN-γ assay and clinical outcomes, highlighting the need for a more
reliable proxy. We hypothesize the existence of a predictable TIL
meta-phenotype that leads to optimal tumor response. Here, we describe
preliminary efforts to integrate prospective and existing patient data with
mathematical models to optimize the TIL meta-phenotype prior to re-injection.
