## Abstract

Cellular adhesion provides one of the fundamental forms of biological
interaction between cells and their surroundings, yet the continuum modelling
of cellular adhesion has remained mathematically challenging. In 2006,
Armstrong et. al. proposed a mathematical model in the form of an
integro-partial differential equation. Although successful in applications, a
derivation from an underlying stochastic random walk has remained elusive. In
this work we develop a framework by which non-local models can be derived from
a space-jump process. We show how the notions of motility and a cell
polarization vector can be naturally included. With this derivation we are able
to include microscopic biological properties into the model. We show that
particular choices yield the original Armstrong model, while others lead to
more general models, including a doubly non-local adhesion model and non-local
chemotaxis models. Finally, we use random walk simulations to confirm that the
corresponding continuum model represents the mean field behaviour of the
stochastic random walk.
