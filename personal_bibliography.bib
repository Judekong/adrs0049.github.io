    abstract="Invasive species raise concern around the globe, and much empirical and theoretical research effort has been devoted to their management. Integrodifference equations are theoretical tools that have been used to understand the spatiotemporal process of a species invasion, with the potential to yield insight into the possible biological control measures. We develop a system of integrodifference equations to explore the potential release of a castrating barnacle parasite Sacculina carcini to control spread and abundance of an invasive species, Carcinus maenas, the European green crab. We find that the parasite does not completely eradicate the green crab population, but has the potential to reduce its density. Our model suggests that the crab population is likely to outrun the spread of the parasite, causing two waves of invasion travelling at different speeds. By performing a sensitivity analysis, we investigate the effects of the demographic parameters on the speed of invasion. To conclude, we discuss the predicted outcomes for the European green crab, and other non-target hosts, of using the castrating barnacle as a biocontrol agent.",

	abstract = {Cellular adhesion provides one of the fundamental forms of biological interaction between cells and their surroundings, yet the continuum modelling of cellular adhesion has remained mathematically challenging. In 2006, Armstrong et. al. proposed a mathematical model in the form of an integro-partial differential equation. Although successful in applications, a derivation from an underlying stochastic random walk has remained elusive. In this work we develop a framework by which non-local models can be derived from a space-jump process. We show how the notions of motility and a cell polarization vector can be naturally included. With this derivation we are able to include microscopic biological properties into the model. We show that particular choices yield the original Armstrong model, while others lead to more general models, including a doubly non-local adhesion model and non-local chemotaxis models. Finally, we use random walk simulations to confirm that the corresponding continuum model represents the mean field behaviour of the stochastic random walk.},

	abstract = {There is an urgent need for reliable effective therapy for patients with metastatic sarcoma. Approaches that manipulate the immune system have shown promise for patients with advanced, widely disseminated malignancies. One of these approaches is adoptive cell therapy (ACT), where tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are isolated from the tumor, expanded ex vivo, and then transferred back to the patient. This approach has shown great promise in melanoma, leading to an objective response in approximately half of treated patients [14]. Standard protocols involve characterization of TIL populations with respect to adaptive CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, but neglect the possible role of the innate lymphoid repertoire. Due to toxicity and the high cost associated with ACT, the IFN-γ release assay is currently used as a proxy to identify suitable TIL isolates for ACT. Efforts in TIL-ACT for sarcoma, which are pre-clinical and pioneered at Moffitt Cancer Center, have shown that only a minority of the TIL cultures show tumor specific activity in ex vivo IFN-γ assays. Surprisingly, internal melanoma trial data reveal a lack of correlation between IFN-γ assay and clinical outcomes, highlighting the need for a more reliable proxy. We hypothesize the existence of a predictable TIL meta-phenotype that leads to optimal tumor response. Here, we describe preliminary efforts to integrate prospective and existing patient data with mathematical models to optimize the TIL meta-phenotype prior to re-injection.},
